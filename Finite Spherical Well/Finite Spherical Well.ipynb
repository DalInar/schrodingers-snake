    "You've learned about how to solve the Schrodinger equation in 3 dimensions for spherically symmetric potentials, $V(\\vec{r})=V(r)$, by using spherical coordinates and searching for a separable solution. As shown in Chapter 4 of Griffiths, the angular part of the solution does not depend on the details of the solutions, and is given by one of the *spherical harmonics*.  The real problem is to solve the *radial equation*, which when we switch variables to $u(r)=rR(r)$ is given by:\n",

When we are looking for the solution is a region of space where the wavefunction should decay (ie, $E<V$), then we should use Hankel functions, which are just linear combinations of the Bessel and Neumann functions. See the first Reference for more about Hankel functions."
