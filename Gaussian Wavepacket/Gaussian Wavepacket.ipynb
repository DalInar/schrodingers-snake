    "Given the state of a system at $t=0$, how will the system evolve over time?  This is one of the most fundamental and important questions one can ask in physics.  Afterall, the point of a theory is to make predictions that an experiment can test.  In quantum mechanics the state of a system  at $t=0$ is given by the wavefunction, $\\Psi(x,0)$, and in order to make predictions we need some way to calculate the wavefunction at other times, $\\Psi(x,t)$.   This allows us to make predictions like: \n",
    "1. How likely is the particle to stay in a particular place?  \n",
    "2. How does the system respond to perturbations?\n",
    "3. How do observables like energy, spin, momentum, magnetization, etc. change in time?\n",
    "\n",
    "As described in Griffiths, Section 2.4, and explored in Griffiths Problem 2.22, one convenient way of obtaining $\\Psi(x,t)$ from $\\Psi(x,0)$ for a free particle is via Fourier Transforms. The logic goes like this - we know that the energy eigenstates of the free particle are given by plane waves, and are characterized by a momentum, $k$.\n",
    "$$\\Psi_k(x,t) \\approx \\exp\\left( i(kx-\\frac{\\hbar k^2}{2m}t)\\right), \\; E_k=\\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2m}$$\n",
    "So at $t=0$, we have a complete set of states, $\\Psi_k(x,0)$, for which we can easily add their time dependence and that we can superimpose to create any other arbitrary state, $\\Psi(x,0)$.  If the weight of eigenstate $\\Psi_k=e^{ikx}$ in the superposition is $\\phi(k)$, then we can write the superposition as\n",
    "$$\\Psi(x,0)=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\phi(k)e^{ikx}dk$$\n",
    "Given $\\Psi(x,0)$, the goal is then to find $\\phi(k)$, which can be done via a Fourier Transform\n",
    "$$\\phi(k)=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\Psi(x,0)e^{-ikx}dx$$\n",
    "Once we know $\\phi(k)$, the Fourier Transform of $\\Psi(x,0)$, we can easily add on the time dependence of each eigenstate and transform back to obtain $\\Psi(x,t)$.\n",
    "$$\\Psi(x,t)=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\phi(k)e^{ i(kx-\\frac{\\hbar k^2}{2m}t)}dk$$\n",
    "So, the recipe of calculating $\\Psi(x,t)$ from $\\Psi(x,0)$ is\n",
    "1. Fourier transform $\\Psi(x,0)$ to get $\\phi(k)$\n",
    "2. Add on the time-dependence, $\\phi(k,t)=\\phi(k)e^{ i\\frac{\\hbar k^2}{2m}t}$\n",
    "3. Inverse Fourier Transform $\\phi(k,t)$ to get $\\Phi(x,t)$\n",
    "\n",
    "One good example of this procedure is the time evolution of a Gaussian wavepacket. Griffiths Problem 2.22 shows you how to do this analytically, and this notebook will teach you how to do it computationally.  The Gaussian wavepacket provides a good testing ground, but a nice thing about the computational solution is that it can be applied to any initial $\\Psi(x,0)$. This is quite valuable, since the integrals involved in the analytic solution are typically quite difficult, usually unsolvable, for anything more complex than a Gaussian. \n"
