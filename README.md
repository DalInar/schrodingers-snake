# Quantum Physics and Python
This is a set of quantum physics exercises in Python, as Jupyter Notebooks.  Some of these notebooks have been used as assignments in undergraduate, introductory quantum physics classes.  They are still under development, but they explore various aspects of quantum mechanics through numerical computation and visualization.  Topics include time evolution of eigenstates and superpositions, transfer matrices, the simple harmonic oscillator, change of bases, the shooting method for numerically solving the Schrodinger equation, etc.

The Introduction to Jupyter folder contains a PDF that will guide you through setting up Python and Jupyter with the Anaconda package, as well as a notebook that will introduce you to Python.  The Project Guide folder contains a PDF that summarizes each project (still in progress!). The Misc Python Practice folder contains notebooks that are meant to provide more practice in using Python to solve simple problems, such as integrating functions and calculating statistical properties.
