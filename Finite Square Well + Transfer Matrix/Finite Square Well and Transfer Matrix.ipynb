    "In the written part of this homework, you learned how to calculate the transmission through a single finite, rectangular barrier by solving a system of equations derived from boundary conditions. A more advanced (and much more powerful) way of performing these sorts of calculations is the *transfer matrix*. Use the references below to learn about this method, and then use it to numerically compute the transmission coefficient as a function of energy for a *double* finite, rectangular barrier.  Assume the barriers have a height of $V_0=2$, a width of $a=1$, and are separated by $b=3$.  Make a plot of the transmission coefficient versus energy, and interpret your findings.\n",
